    "### Introduction to Feature Relationships in Cycling Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In data analysis, understanding the relationships between features is crucial to gain insights and make informed decisions. In this project, we are working with a dataset related to professional cycling races, containing information on both cyclists and races.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of analyzing feature relationships involves identifying patterns, dependencies, and correlations between the various features in the dataset. This analysis helps in understanding how certain variables, such as a cyclist's performance, are influenced by race characteristics or personal attributes like weight and height.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives:\n",
    "- **Explore and analyze relationships** between features, both categorical and numerical.\n",
    "- **Identify patterns, dependencies, and correlations** to uncover potential trends and insights.\n",
    "- Provide valuable context for subsequent tasks such as **feature engineering** and **clustering**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on these objectives, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset, which will inform our analysis and decision-making processes."
