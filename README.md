# Data Mining Project


This project focuses on implementing and analyzing a data mining pipeline centered around professional cycling races. The primary objective is to gain insights into the performance and characteristics of cyclists and races through various data mining techniques. By leveraging the provided dataset, which includes detailed information about individual races and participating cyclists, we aim to uncover patterns and relationships that can inform our understanding of the sport.

The dataset comprises two main tables: cyclists and races. The cyclists table contains details about individual races, while the races table provides information about the cyclists participating in those races. Key features of the dataset include race identifiers, names, points, lengths, profiles, and cyclist-specific attributes such as weight and height.

The project is structured into several tasks, each contributing to a comprehensive analysis of the data. These tasks include data understanding, data transformation, and clustering. The ultimate goal is to identify and describe groups of instances using clustering algorithms, providing a deeper understanding of the dynamics within professional cycling races.

In addition to the technical analysis, the project requires a thorough report that explains the motivations behind the chosen analysis, the methodologies employed, and the insights gained. The report should also discuss the limitations of the results and provide clear justifications for the choices made throughout the project.

By completing this project, we aim to demonstrate the application of data mining techniques in a real-world context, showcasing the potential of data-driven approaches in sports analytics.
